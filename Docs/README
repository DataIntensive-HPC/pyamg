Requirements: Sphinx
  
The files in pyamg/Docs such as

    pyamg/Docs/source/conf.py
    pyamg/Docs/source/index.rst
    pyamg/Docs/Makefile

are created with sphinx-quickstart and are in the repo.  The files pyamg/Docs/source/pyamg.*.rst 
tell sphinx which modules will have documentation built based on the current documentation strings.
These .rst files are reasonably up-to-date, but the freshest .rst files can be gotten by downloading 
[generate_modules.py](https://bitbucket.org/thomaswaldmann/sphinx-autopackage-script/src)
and placing generate_modules.py in the pyamg/Docs directory.  Then remove all old .rst files

    rm source/pyamg.*.rst

and generate new ones with 
    
    python generate_modules.py -d ./source -s rst -m 5 $BUILD/lib.macosx-10.3-fat-2.6/ build

where $BUILD is your PyAMG build directory and the lib.* directory is the appropriate
one from your most recent build.  Note that the .rst files do not have to be updated to generate
html documentation.

To make the html documentation, do

    make html

then look in pyamg/Docs/build/html for the html files.
